Calculates segmented linear regression based on tiering status. 

To use, run the following .py files in order:
run data_handler.py , 
run stats.py , 
run plotter.py , 

Looking to automate this with a while TRUE loop and user input to control the above,
but this is a draft pipeline so we'll see how this grows in future
